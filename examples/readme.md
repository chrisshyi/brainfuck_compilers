# Assembly Examples

Just a directory of example commented textual assembly and assembly-like programs. All programs assume 64-bit architectures. All `.s` use GAS syntax and either x86 instructions, ARM instructions, and will make either Linux or macOS syscalls. All `.wat` files are WebAssembly textual representation files. All `.llvm` are LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation) files.
